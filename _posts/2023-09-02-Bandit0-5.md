- **SOLUTION**:

```terminal
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Welcome to OverTheWire!

Enjoy your stay!

bandit0@bandit:~$

```

We list the content of the current directory, we find a file called **readme**, we read it and we get the password.

```terminal
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 41 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root    3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     675 May 15  2017 .profile
-rw-r-----  1 bandit1 bandit0   33 May  7  2020 readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOlxxxxxxxxx
bandit0@bandit:~$
```

## **Level 2**: Unusually named Files.

- **GOAL**: 
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-** located in the home directory


- **SOLUTION**

```terminal
$ ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220                            
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat -

```

We can't read it the normal way. We search for this problem, and find we can read it using `cat ./-`

```terminal
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHzxxxxxxxxx
bandit1@bandit:~$
```

## **Level 3**: Spaces in a filename.

- **GOAL**:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory

- **SOLUTION**

```terminal
$ ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220                            
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 41 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root    3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root     675 May 15  2017 .profile
-rw-r-----  1 bandit3 bandit2   33 May  7  2020 spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5xxx
bandit2@bandit:~$
```

## **Level 4**: Hidden Files.

- **GOAL**:
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

- **SOLUTION**:

```terminal
$ ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220                            
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -al
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 May  7  2020 .hidden
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFxxx
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$
```

## **Level 5**: File types, specifically human-readable files.

- **GOAL**
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

- **SOLUTION**

```terminal
$ ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220                            
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file00
/`2ғ%rL~5gbandit4@bandit:~/inhere$
```

We get some weird data when we try to read the file, let's list the type of every file with the command `file`

```terminal
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAxxx
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$
```
